# ISYE6748Sandia

Applied Analytics Practicum by Yipei Zhang (yzhang3432@gatech.edu) and Salman Azmi (sazmi3@gatech.edu) sponsored by Sandia National Laboratories.

## Instructions for Use

1. An active anaconda/jupyter installation is required. You may use Google CoLab, but it has had compilation issues in the past with common Python analytics libraries.
2. Install Pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
3. In the top of the notebook viewer, you should have an option to select "Restart and run all." This is the recommended selection.
